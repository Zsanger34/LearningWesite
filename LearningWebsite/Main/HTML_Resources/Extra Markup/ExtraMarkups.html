    <p>
        <h2>Doctypes</h2>
        <(!)DOCTYPE> We use this because there is multiple version on html and we need to specify which one we are using
        It helps the browser render the code correctly
        different types are
        <ol>
            <li>html (html 5)</li>
            <li>html PUBLIC then extra definition which you can look up (Other version)</li>
            <li><.?xml version="1.0" ? (XML Declaration)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Comments in HTML</h2>
        <!    > as seen in the rest of the code
        comment can be useful to organize and lael projects

        <h2>Id Attributes</h2>
            id="*ID*" can be used as a unique identifier to separate Elements from each other
            Can be used to style sections differently

        <h2>Class Attributes</h2>
        class="*CLASS*" can be used like ID Attributes, but you can classify more than one elements if you
        put multiple elements in one class

        <h2>Block Elements</h2>
        These elements will be you h1, p, or ul elements and so on they seem to start a new line within your code

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        These elements will be you a, b, em tags which are written in line with text

        <h2>Grouping Text & Elements in a block</h2>
        the <.div> tag allows you to group elements and text together to sort of section out your code.'
        so you can use the id Attributes to effect a large block
        <h2>Grouping Text & Elements inline</h2>
        This is the same as the grouping in a block but uses <.span> and is used to group text or elements within the line together
        You can use the class attribute to effect a large amount of elements and text within the line

        <h2>Iframes</h2>
        An iframe is like a little window within your webiste it allows you to put things like a map etc. within
        an example is
        <iframe width="450" height="350" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=suny%20buffalo&t=&z=13&ie=UTF8&iwloc=&output=embed"> </iframe>

        <h2>Meta</h2>
        The Meta Element lives inside the <.head> element. It contains information about that web page
        its invisible and only there to talk to the search engine.
        it contains infomation like who created the page, if its time sensitive(The page can expire in that case)
        the meta tag is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag
        some of the most commonly used attributes are
        <ul>
            <li>
                Description: Contains a description of the page it tells the search engine what the website is about.

            </li>
            <li>
                Keywords: List of comma-separated words that a user might search on to find the page.
                This no longer really effects on how search engines index the site
            </li>
            <li>
