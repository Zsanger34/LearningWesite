        <h2>Doctypes</h2>
        <(!)DOCTYPE> We use this because there is multiple version on html and we need to specify which one we are using
        It helps the browser render the code correctly
        different types are
        <ol>
            <li>html (html 5)</li>
            <li>html PUBLIC then extra definition which you can look up (Other version)</li>
            <li><.?xml version="1.0" ? (XML Declaration)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Comments in HTML</h2>
        <!    > as seen in the rest of the code
        comment can be useful to organize and lael projects

        <h2>Id Attributes</h2>
            id="*ID*" can be used as a unique identifier to separate Elements from each other
            Can be used to style sections differently

        <h2>Class Attributes</h2>
        class="*CLASS*" can be used like ID Attributes, but you can classify more than one elements if you
        put multiple elements in one class

        <h2>Block Elements</h2>
        These elements will be you h1, p, or ul elements and so on they seem to start a new line within your code

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        These elements will be you a, b, em tags which are written in line with text

        <h2>Grouping Text & Elements in a block</h2>
        the <.div> tag allows you to group elements and text together to sort of section out your code.'
        so you can use the id Attributes to effect a large block
        <h2>Grouping Text & Elements inline</h2>
        This is the same as the grouping in a block but uses <.span> and is used to group text or elements within the line together
        You can use the class attribute to effect a large amount of elements and text within the line

        <h2>Iframes</h2>
        An iframe is like a little window within your webiste it allows you to put things like a map etc. within
        an example is
        <iframe width="450" height="350" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=suny%20buffalo&t=&z=13&ie=UTF8&iwloc=&output=embed"> </iframe>
